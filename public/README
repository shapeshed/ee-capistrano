Public files
=====================

Put your ExpressionEngine website in here. If you'd like to share folders across releases (e.g. /FCKEditor, /images/uploads/) move these folders to /shared and update the Capistrano recipe to create a symlink to these folders after the deploy process is finished. There is commented code at the end of the Capistrano files that will do this for you.
